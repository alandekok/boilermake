# boilermake: A reusable, but flexible, boilerplate Makefile.
#
# Author: Dan Moulding <dmoulding@gmail.com> (2008)

# Caution: Don't edit this Makefile! Create your own main.mk and other
#          submakefiles, which will be included by this Makefile.
#          Only edit this if you need to modify boilermake's behavior (fix
#          bugs, add features, etc).

# Older versions og GNU Make lack capabilities needed by this system.
# Instead, running "make" returns "nothing to do".  In order to tell
# the user what really happened, we check the version of GNU make.

# Note: Parameterized "functions" in this makefile that are marked with
#       "USE WITH EVAL" are only useful in conjuction with eval. This is
#       because those functions result in a block of Makefile syntax that must
#       be evaluated after expansion. Since they must be used with eval, most
#       instances of "$" within them need to be escaped with a second "$" to
#       accomodate the double expansion that occurs when eval is invoked.
